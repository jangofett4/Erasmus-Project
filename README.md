## Erasmus Website Project  
This is a website for our Special Skills and Practice lecture in Erasmus period.  
This is a completely static website (except loading partner data from a static file).  

Helpful links are more visible to help students find necessary information (such as accommodation information).  
Made using purely Bootstrap and PHP (php pages are not dynamic except one).
